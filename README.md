# Learning Metric Spaces By Doing It!

This is a personal project of leaning topology and metric spaces by formalising them in Lean.

Based on the [lecture notes](https://union.ic.ac.uk/rcsu/mathsoc/files/M2PM5-16.pdf) of M2PM5 (Metric Spaces & Topology) (requires Imperial account) from 2016.

Currently I have formalised: 
- Metric Spaces
  - Basic properties of the metric
  - Some examples of metric spaces
  - Continuous functions on metric spaces
  - Bounded and diameter of metric spaces
  - Open and closed sets
  - Closure and interior
  - Convergence of sequences
  - Connected metric spaces
  - Metric spaces form a *complete lattice* with closed sets
  - Metric spaces form a *category* with continuous functions and isometries
 - Topology
  - Basic properties of topologial spaces
  - Continuous functions on topological spaces
  - Homeomorphisms
  - Subspaces
  - Hausdorff spaces
